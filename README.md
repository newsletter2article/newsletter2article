This repository is dedicated to hosting the generated articles for the application: [Newsletter2Article](https://newsletter2article.com).

For detailed documentation on how the application works, please visit the [Documentation](https://github.com/reneralmeida/newsletter2article).

If you generated an article and forgot to share or lost the link, the page is always:

## Content Guidelines

I strive to maintain a repository filled with high-quality, proper journalistic articles.
To ensure this, the following types of content are strictly prohibited:
- Hate speech
- Spam
- Pornography

Keep in mind that I'm trying this out to see how well and how much use this will get.
If I see blatant abuse, I could erase this repo and just host a personal page for the newsletters I find deserve to be shared. So, please, try and respect the rules, don't make me rebase, reset the head of this or even nuke the whole thing if necessary.

In an age of widespread misinformation, where any knucklehead can record himself spouting all sorts of nonsense just to get views and line his pocket, I find that proper investigative journalism, a dying breed sadly, deserves some more exposure. If you feel the same, you're most welcome to join in the effort!
